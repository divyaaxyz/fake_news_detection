# fake_news_detection
A machine learning project which classifies news as fake or real 

Objective:
To build an application that is able to classify news articles to be as fake or real/original through the learning it got from the datasets being provided to it.

Methodology:

Result:
Our application is able to detect a fake news from tons of news articles including both fake and real news by using algorithms like random forest and naïve bayes etc. out of which random forest has highest accuracy .

Conclusion/Scope:
People are generally not able to detect a news is fake or not just by looking and reading it because the fake news is presented in a way that it seems to be news about a true incident that’s why this application with the help machine learning is able to detect fake news the accuracy of 97.8% from random forest proves that.
