RESULT ANALYSIS:
In this research paper an investigation into fake news detection by machine learning was done. Algorithms like Naive Bayes,
Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression were used for the study. The models were trained to do supervised learning.
 For our dataset, Random Forest gave highest accuracy that is 97.81% followed by Decision Tree (97.6%),Logistic Regression
 (95.48%) , Naive Bayes(92.83%%).

CONCLUSION: 
In the 21st century, the majority of the tasks are done online. Newspapers that were earlier preferred as hardcopies are now
 being substituted by applications like Facebook, Twitter, and news articles to be read online. WhatsAppâ€˜s forwards are also
 a major source. The growing problem of fake news only makes things more complicated and tries to change or hamper the opinion
 and attitude of people towards use of digital technology. When a person is deceived by the real news two possible things
 happen- People start believing that their perceptions about a particular topic are true as assumed. Thus, in order to curb
 the phenomenon, we have developed our Fake news Detection system that takes input from the user and classify it to be true
 or fake. To implement this, various NLP and Machine LearningTechniques have to be used. The model is trained using an
 appropriate dataset and performance evaluation is also done using various performance measures. The best model, i.e. the
 model with highest accuracy is used to classify the news headlines or articles. As evident above for static search.

Our best model came out to be RANDOM FOREST with accuracy of 97.8%. Hence, we can say that if a user feed a particular news
 article or its headline in this model, there are 97.8% chances that the news will be classified as per its true nature.
